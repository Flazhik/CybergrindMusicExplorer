## Disclaimer

Custom music in Cyber Grind playlist is an upcoming feature of ULTRAKILL, so you can use this mod until custom tracks
are officially supported.
This mod does not affect the folder with original soundtrack, so you can combine it with your custom tracks.

## Installation

1. Download the freshest **BepInEx** release from [here](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v5.4.21). It's
   recommended to choose **BepInEx_x64** release unless you're certain you have a 32-bit system

2. Extract the contents of **BepInEx** archive in your local **ULTRAKILL** folder. If you're not sure where this folder
   is located, find **ULTRAKILL** in your Steam Library > Right mouse click > **Properties** > **Local files** > **Browse**
3. Download the CybergrindMusicExplorer
   archive [here](https://github.com/Flazhik/CybergrindMusicExplorer/releases/download/v1.2.3/CybergrindMusicExplorer.v1.2.3.zip), then
   extract its contents at **ULTRAKILL/BepInEx/plugins** (create *plugins* folder manually in case it's missing)

## Using the mod

1. Move your custom tracks/folders to *ULTRAKILL/Cybergrind/Music*
2. Launch the game and go to the blue Cyber Grind settings terminal
3. **Music** section of the terminal should now contain two folders for original score and your own tracks
4. Fill the playlist the way you want and enjoy
5. Optional: Music Explorer settings menu is available by pressing F4 (by default)

## Additional features
- Custom track boost: if your track is still too quiet, you can always add up to 10dB to it. Please use it carefully
- Next track hotkey: Skip the track you're not in the mood to listen to
- All these feature are available in Cybergrind by pressing F4
